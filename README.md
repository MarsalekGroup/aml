Short Description
-----------------

This is a Python package to automatically build the reference set
for the training of _Neural Network Potentials_ (NNPs),
and eventually other machine-learned potentials,
in an automated, data-driven fashion.
For that purpose, a large set of reference configurations
sampled in a physically meaningful way (typically with molecular dynamics)
is filtered and the most important points for the representation of the
_Potential Energy Surface_ (PES) are identified.
This is done by using a set of NNPs, called a committee, for
error estimates of individual configurations.
By iteratively adding the points with the largest
error in the energy/force prediction, the reference
set is progressively extended and optimized.

Keywords:

* Active learning
* Query by committee
* Ensemble averaging
* Committee machines
* Neural Network Potentials
